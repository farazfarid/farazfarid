## Hey there! 👋

I'm Faraz, a software engineer who's been building things on the web for over a decade. These days, I'm working at **SOPTIM AG** where I develop software for the energy sector—think grid operations and market communication systems that help keep the lights on.

I recently finished my Master's in AI at Heinrich Heine University, where I researched how explainable AI behaves when you try to mess with it (spoiler: it gets interesting). Before that, I wore a lot of hats—CTO roles, full-stack development, even ran my own game studio for a few years.

**What I'm up to:**
- Building enterprise software for energy infrastructure at SOPTIM
- Exploring the world of agentic AI and large language models
- Always learning something new in the AI space
- Playing basketball when I'm not behind a keyboard

**Things I actually enjoy working with:**
React and the whole modern frontend ecosystem, Spring Boot for backend stuff, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), and lately I've been deep into AI/ML work with various LLMs and frameworks.

**Languages I speak:**
German and Dari natively, professional English, and I can get by pretty well in Spanish and Arabic. Currently butchering French as a beginner.

## 🛠️ What I Work With

**Languages:** Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, C++

**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Vue.js, Angular, TailwindCSS, Three.js

**Backend:** Spring Boot, Node.js, .NET, Django

**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes

**AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI APIs, scikit-learn

**Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebase

**Other stuff:** Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender (from my game dev days)

Working on cloud-based solutions for energy market stakeholders. Making sure critical infrastructure stays stable and efficient.

**Multiple CTO Roles** *(2021 - 2024)*
Led technical strategy and digital transformation for several ventures across e-commerce, content platforms, and education. Built scalable platforms, managed tech budgets, and got my hands dirty with everything from Shopify to custom web applications.

**Adesso SE** - Software Engineer *(Oct 2021 - Mar 2024)*
Engineered Angular and Spring Boot solutions for corporate time-tracking and parking automation. Built secure internal tools that actually made people's jobs easier.

**Nova Game Studios** - Founder & CEO *(2015 - 2019)*
Started my own game studio, developed and published "Two Men Dungeon" (local multiplayer game). Did everything—Unity3D development, 3D modeling in Blender, built the website, handled the release. It was a wild ride.

## 🏆 Some Cool Stuff

- Won the **Gemini API Developer Competition**
- Got first place at **Jugend Forscht** in Computer Science
- My Master's thesis explored adversarial attacks on explainable AI systems
- Led technical operations for 5+ companies at the same time (yes, it was chaotic)
